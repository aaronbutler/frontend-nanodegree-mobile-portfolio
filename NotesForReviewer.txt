Please see metrics.txt for information about my optimization steps, and my gruntfile for a description of what is (and is not) part of my build script. For code review, please use the files in the source/ directory (note - I pretty much left inherited code alone, although I completely rewrote source/views/*, hopefully at least close to conforming to style guide). For running the pages, please use the files in the deploy/ directory.
